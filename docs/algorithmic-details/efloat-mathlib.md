# efloat: correctly rounded arithmetic and math library

`efloat<nlimbs>` is Universal's adaptive-precision binary float: a sign, an `int64_t` exponent
and a significand of any number of 32-bit limbs. This page is the design record of its
arithmetic and its math library: what each function computes and how, why it computes it that
way, what was tried and dropped, how the results are verified, how fast they are next to MPFR,
and what is still open. It is written for whoever works on the speed or the accuracy next.

The code carries the local detail: every header states its algorithm, the error bound of each
unrounded evaluation and the issue that introduced it. This page ties those together, and keeps
the history and the measurements, which the code does not.

- Headers: `include/sw/universal/number/efloat/` (`efloat_impl.hpp`, `efloat_mpn.hpp`, `math/*.hpp`)
- Regression tests: `elastic/efloat/{api,arithmetic,conversion,math}/`
- Accuracy against MPFR: `benchmark/accuracy/efloat/mpfr_check.cpp`
- Speed against MPFR: `benchmark/performance/arithmetic/efloat/mpfr/mpfr_gap.cpp`
- Speed against mpmath and gmpy2: `benchmark/performance/arithmetic/efloat/mpmath_gap.{cpp,py}`
- Tracking: Epic #1763 (beat MPFR at 128-8192 bits), #1782 (this page), #1783 (cbrt, hypot,
  fma, fmod and remainder made correctly rounded)

## 1. The contract

Every function below is designed to be **correctly rounded**:
the result is the exact mathematical value rounded once to the result's precision, in whichever
of the four IEEE rounding modes `efloat_rounding_mode` selects (nearest-even, toward zero,
toward +inf, toward -inf). What backs that is not a proof. The arithmetic, `sqrt`, `hypot`,
`fma` and the conversions round exact results, and `fmod` and `remainder` return them, so they
are correct by construction. The other functions
rest on two things that are measured, not proven: the error bound of each unrounded evaluation
(section 2) and a retry limit that has not been shown to suffice (section 2, item 3). What
is established is agreement with MPFR on every case checked, 32-8192 bits, in all four modes
(section 6). Signed zeros, infinities, NaN and the exception flags follow C and IEEE 754.

**The result's precision** (#1757, PR #1758). A value constructed from a native `int`, `float`
or `double` carries no precision of its own. An operation takes the wider precision of the
operands that carry one; when none does, the result rounds at the default precision
(`set_default_precision()`, else `32 nlimbs` bits) and carries none either. A math function's
result has its argument's precision (`result_precision()` in `math/exponent.hpp`). So
`x * 3 / 7` with `x` at 640 bits runs at 640 bits, not at the type's width.

Before #1758, `efloat<100>(3)` carried 3200 bits, and `x op literal` silently ran at 3200 bits
(#1714 measured `exp` at 2048 bits running 9x slower than the 600 it was asked for). Of the four
options weighed in #1757 (exact literals sized to their bits; an exact flag that does not vote;
documentation only; mixed-type operators), the chosen design combines the second and the
fourth.

## 2. How a function is correctly rounded

All of the math library uses one scheme, in `math/exponent.hpp`.

1. **An unrounded evaluation with a stated error bound.** Each function has a
   `*_working(x, target)` that evaluates at `target + exp_log_guard_bits` (64) bits and returns
   a value within `2^(scale - target - 64 + error_bits)` of the exact result. Each function's
   `error_bits` is a named constant next to its code (table in section 4).
2. **Ziv's test.** `can_round(y, precision, correct)` reads `y`'s bits from just past the
   rounding position down to the error bound. If they are neither all 0 nor all 1, no rounding
   boundary lies within the error, and `y` rounds to the same value as the exact result in
   every mode.
3. **Ziv's strategy.** `round_ziv(evaluate, precision, error_bits)` evaluates, tests, and if the
   test fails, evaluates again at twice the target. What it is given is a finite approximation;
   the premise is about the exact result, which must differ from every rounding boundary, so
   that some precision separates the two and an unbounded loop would terminate. The boundaries
   are binary fractions. Every caller returns the arguments whose exact result is a binary
   fraction before reaching `round_ziv` (item 4): `exp2` at an integer, `log2` of a power of 2,
   `pow` at an exact power, and so on. What remains is irrational (transcendental, or algebraic
   like `exp2(1/2) = sqrt(2)`) or rational but not a binary fraction, so never a boundary.
   The loop is bounded, though: after **eight retries**, at 256 times the target, it rounds the
   last value whether or not the test passed. So the guarantee is correct rounding unless the
   exact result lies within about `2^-(256 P)` of a rounding boundary, relative to its size;
   past that, the result is the last evaluation rounded once, which is faithful but not proven
   correct. There is no proof that eight suffice for any function here. The evidence is that
   every MPFR check has agreed, and the heuristic of the table-maker's-dilemma literature
   (Lefevre and Muller's searches of the hardest cases for double precision): a P-bit
   argument's result is expected to come no closer to a boundary than about `2^-(2P + c)`,
   for a small c, which a few doublings already resolve. The retry count is not reported,
   so a run cannot tell whether it reached the limit.
4. **Exact results are formed, not approximated.** A boundary is a binary fraction, so only an
   exact result can sit on one: `exp2(k)`, `log10(10^k)`, `pow(x, n)` with a narrow enough
   result, `sqrt` of a square, `acos(1) = +0`, `tgamma(n) = (n-1)!` and so on are computed
   outright and rounded once (#1774). They keep the argument's precision (`round_result`).
5. **Leading term plus a signed correction.** When the result is `L + c` with `L` exact and
   `|c| < 2^-(P+4) |L|` of known sign (sin of a tiny x, erf near +-1, exp of a tiny x),
   `round_near(L, direction, P)` rounds `L` moved `2^-(P+32)` of itself toward `c`, as MPFR's
   `mpfr_round_near_x` does.

The retry rate is low because the guard is wide: about `2^-29` per call for sin/cos/tan and
`2^-45` for exp/log (#1772); `exp_log_guard_bits = 64` is larger than a first try needs.

**The error bounds are measured, not proven.** Each `*_error_bits` was set from evaluations at
`P` against evaluations at `2P + 128`, in all four modes (the intermediate operations round in
the current mode), across 32-8192 bits, and then given slack. The measured worst cases sit at
least 17-18 bits inside the declared bounds (#1772, #1774, #1779, #1781).

**Ziv hides a missing guard.** A subtraction that cancels exactly leaves trailing zeros, which
`can_round` reads as "too close to call", so it retries at twice the precision and the final
result is still right. A deleted cancellation guard therefore passes every comparison of
results; only a direct check of the `*_working` error contract catches it (#1779). Tests that
cover a new function must check the contract, not just the rounded results.

## 3. Arithmetic

Storage is a `std::vector<uint32_t>`, most significant limb first. The kernels in
`efloat_mpn.hpp` pack operands into 64-bit limbs, least significant first, work on those, and
round the exact result once into the destination (`assign_rounded`), with no allocation up to
2048 bits.

| operation | algorithm | thresholds | PR |
|---|---|---|---|
| `+` `-` | aligned sum in a stack frame, two guard limbs plus a sticky bit; in-place `+=` | | #1758, #1766, #1767 |
| `*` | 64x64->128 schoolbook, dedicated squaring (`x * x`), subtractive Karatsuba, blocks for unbalanced operands | `karatsuba_threshold = 24`, `karatsuba_sqr_threshold = 32` limbs | #1767 |
| `/` | exact quotient: schoolbook with the Moller-Granlund 3-by-2 reciprocal, Burnikel-Ziegler divide and conquer (GMP's `dcpi1_div_qr`) above the threshold; remainder becomes the sticky bit | `dc_div_threshold = 16` limbs | #1741, #1769 |
| `/ int` | one-limb divisor, Moller-Granlund 2-by-1 reciprocal, in place | | #1766 |
| `sqrt` | exact integer root and remainder by Zimmermann's Karatsuba square root (GMP's `mpn_sqrtrem`), remainder as sticky bit | | #1770 |

| from decimal text | convert at the target plus 64 guard bits, retry wider only when the guard bits read `0111...1` | widths 8192, 32768 | #1740 |

**History and rejected alternatives**

- Division was bit-serial until #1741 (one compare/subtract/shift per quotient bit, about 37
  multiplies' worth at 608 bits). Knuth's Algorithm D replaced it, then #1769 moved it to
  64-bit limbs and divide and conquer. **Newton reciprocal division was rejected** (#1769): at
  8192 bits a multiply costs 4.87 us and DC division 8.4 us, about 1.7 multiplies, while Newton
  needs three or more multiplies even with short products. GMP itself only switches to it past
  about 1000 limbs.
- `sqrt` was Newton's iteration from a one-bit seed with a fixed 7 steps, which capped it at
  about 97 digits (#1140, fixed in #1143). It then misrounded near halfway points and set
  Inexact on exact roots, because it rounded from 64 guard bits without knowing the remainder
  (73,500-case MPFR check on the old code: 409 wrong results and 1,151 wrong Inexact flags).
  **A Newton reciprocal square root was built and rejected** (#1770): written in efloat
  operations it was slower than the old code below 8192 bits (0.686 us against 0.346 at 128
  bits, while the exact `sqrtrem` took 0.126). The lesson recorded there: estimate the overhead
  of efloat operations before building an algorithm out of them; small sizes need limb-level
  code.
- Before #1767 a multiply made about six allocations. 64-bit limbs and Karatsuba made `a*b`
  2.7x faster at 512 bits and 5.8x at 8192.
- Storage stays 32-bit and most significant first: `bits()`, `setlimb()`, the math library and
  ereal read `_limb` directly, so #1767 changed only the kernels (#1762 steps 2-3 not done).
- Zero signs were wrong in `*`, `/` and exact cancellation until #1773 (#1768).

|---|---|---|---|
| `exp` | `x = k ln2 + r`, `r` halved below `2^-T`, `T = 0.25 sqrt(F)`; series in fixed point by tapered rectangular splitting, squared back; `abs(k) < 2^62` | 16 | exponent.hpp |

"Error bits" is the function's `*_error_bits`: its unrounded value lies within
`2^(scale - target - 64 + error_bits)` of the exact result.

### 4.1 exp family

- **Reduction.** `k = round(x / ln2)` from a double estimate, corrected once from `r` when `x`
  passes `2^52`; `ln2` at the working precision plus 64 bits, so `k ln2` keeps its accuracy for
  any `|k| < 2^62` (#1777). Before #1777 the range stopped at `|x| < 2^17`. Per-`k` widths of
  `ln2` were rejected: they re-grew the cache and cost 9-12% at 8192 bits.
- **Series** (#1788). `r` is halved `h` times, to `s = |r| / 2^h` below `2^-T`, and `exp(+-s)`
  is summed in fixed point (`fixed_series` in `exponent.hpp`).
  - **Fixed point.** Every value is a natural number `V = floor(v 2^F)` in `n + 1` 64-bit limbs,
    with `F = 64 n` fraction bits and `F >= P + 64 + T + 16`. The binary point sits on a limb
    boundary, so a product drops whole limbs. Inside the series nothing normalizes, merges
    precisions or rounds; each step truncates.
  - **Rectangular splitting** (Smith 1989), with blocks of `m ~ sqrt(N)` terms. With
    `T_k = A_i P_j / D_ij` for `k = i m + j`, where `P_j = s^j` and `D_ij = (i m + 1) ...
    (i m + j)`, the series is a Horner scheme in `P_m / D_im` over the blocks
    `B_i = sum_j P_j / D_ij`. Each block is formed over its common denominator with one-limb
    multipliers (`addmul_1`) and one one-limb division. Only the `m` powers and the `N / m`
    Horner steps are full products. `m` is capped so that a block's divisor fits in a limb.
  - **Negative arguments.** The terms alternate. Every partial value stays positive, so the
    kernel needs no signed arithmetic and no final reciprocal.
  - **Squaring back.** The `h` squarings are fixed-point squares, `n + 1` limbs each.
- **Error.** There are about `N + 3N/m + m` truncations of `2^-F` each, under `2^10` of them at
  8192 bits. The tail of the series lies below `2^-(F + 3)`, and the `h` squarings multiply
  the relative error by `2^h`. That leaves `2^(h + 11 - F) <= 2^-(P + 69)`, inside
  `exp_error_bits`. Measured against MPFR from 24 to 8192 bits, the worst case lies 33-73 bits
  inside the declared bound. `elastic/efloat/math/exp_kernel.cpp` checks the bound against a
  plain efloat Taylor series at `2P + 256` bits. 11 of 12 mutations of the kernel fail that
  test. The twelfth halves one time fewer, which changes only the speed, because the term count
  comes from the actual `s`.
- **Tapering** (#1790). Block `b` enters the sum scaled by `T_(bm) < 2^-G_b`, so it is formed
  on the top `n - q_b` limbs, with `64 q_b <= G_b - 8`. Its truncation, scaled by `T_(bm)`,
  stays below `2^-(F + 8)`. On its way down a block, the Horner value gains the limbs the next
  block keeps. This took `exp` from 1.1x to 0.8x MPFR at 2048 bits and from 1.6x to 1.1x at 8192.
- **The halving target.** `T = 0.25 sqrt(F)` is the optimum measured with tapering, to within
  the noise of a flat curve, from 128 to 8192 bits: 4 at 128 bits and 23 at 8192. Before
  tapering it was `0.4 sqrt(F)` (#1788). A cost model that priced a scalar step at a tenth of a
  product chose 34 at 128 bits and 46 at 8192, and ran 1.8x and 1.05x slower: it underrated
  what a squaring of a few limbs costs.
- **History.** Before #1739: `ln2` was a 59-digit literal (results stopped at about 2^-200) and
  the series stopped at 100 terms (about 680 bits). At 608 bits `exp` took 957 us against
  mpmath's 11 (#1714); #1741 brought that to 20 us and #1754 to 15.6 us.
- **History.** Before #1788 the series ran in efloat arithmetic: one rounded multiply,
  divide and add per term, after up to `sqrt(P)` halvings. That was 2.3-3.3x MPFR. The fixed-point
  kernel (#1788) ran at 0.7-0.9x MPFR up to 512 bits, 1.1x at 2048 bits and 1.5-1.75x at 8192,
  over arguments with `|r|` from 0 to `ln2 / 2` of either sign. Tapering (#1790) brought that to
  0.7-0.8x up to 2048 bits and 1.1x at 8192.
- **Work per call** (`|r| ~ 1/4`, #1790 targets): at 128 bits, `N = 34` terms in blocks of
  `m = 6`, 10 products and 3 squarings on 5 limbs. At 8192 bits, 281 terms with `m = 7` (capped
  so the divisor fits in a limb), 46 products, most of them tapered, and 22 squarings on 131
  limbs.
- **Open.** Binary splitting (MPFR's `exp_3`) for the widest precisions. At 8192 bits the
  products are most of the time, and efloat's 8192-bit product is itself 2.2x MPFR's, so
  Toom-3 would help there first. A two-limb block divisor would allow `m ~ sqrt(N) = 14`. The same kernel would also serve the series of `sin`/`cos` and
  `atanh`, and `expm1` below 1/2 still sums in efloat arithmetic. A cheaper first Ziv try is
  not needed for exp, which is already below MPFR's time at small precisions.

### 4.2 log family

- **Table and series** (#1754, mpmath's method below 2500 bits): `x = 2^e m`,
  `m` in `[sqrt(1/2), sqrt(2))`, `c = j/512` the nearest grid point, and
  `log x = e ln2 + log c + 2 atanh((m - c)/(m + c))`, gaining about 21 bits a term. Keeping `m`
  around 1 means `x` near 1 needs only the series, with no cancellation against `e ln2`. The
  363 table entries are computed on first use and cached per thread.
- **AGM** (#1771; Brent 1976, Brent and Zimmermann *Modern Computer Arithmetic* 4.8.2, as MPFR
  does it): `s = x 2^m > 2^(W/2)`, `log s = pi s / (2 AGM(s, 4))`, `log x = log s - m ln2`.
  About `2 log2 W` steps, each a multiply, an exact root and a halving.
- **The switch.** AGM once `W > 144 max(10, k)` for `x` within `2^-k` of 1
  (`log_agm_bits_per_series_bit`, measured: the series costs `W M(W) / k`, the AGM
  `log(W) M(W)`). Without the near-1 case the crossover is about 1450 bits.
- **History.** Newton's iteration on `exp` (about 4.5 `exp` calls per `log`) until #1754 below
  8192 bits and #1771 above. At 8192 bits that Newton had an absolute, not relative, error: for
  `x = 1 - 2^-7481 r` it was off by `2^711` ulps. #1771 made `log` 5x faster at 8192 bits
  (1441 to 289 us).
- **Open.** The Sasaki-Kanada theta-function start (about a fifth fewer AGM steps).

### 4.3 Trigonometric

- **Reduction** (`reduce_half_pi`): `x = k pi/2 + r`, `|r| <= pi/4`, with `pi` computed by
  Machin's formula at the needed width and cached. The subtraction cancels about
  `scale(x) - scale(r)` bits, and `x` can lie as close to `k pi/2` as its own precision allows,
  so the reduction retries wider until `r` keeps `bits + 64` correct bits, up to three times
  `2(P + scale(x))`. This is a division at widened precision, not Payne-Hanek: its cost grows
  with `scale(x)`. `|x| < 0.785` skips the division (#1766).
  - **Below `2^40`** (#1790), `k = round(x 2/pi)` comes from `double`. It lies within `2^-12` of
    `x 2/pi`, so `k` is the nearest integer, or its neighbour next to a half-integer, which
    leaves `|r|` at most `2^-12 pi/2` past `pi/4`; that is harmless to the versine. `r = x - k
    pi/2` is still formed, and widened, at full precision. This replaced the division at the
    working precision, a fifth of `sin` at 128 bits.
- **Tiny arguments** (#1790). `sin`, `cos` and `tan` return `x` or `1`, moved toward the next
  term, through `round_near` when that term lies below `2^-(P+4)` of the value. The cuts were
  2 bits more conservative than the series allow. They are now `2 scale(x) < -P - 3` for `sin`
  (`x^2/6 < 2^-(P+4)`) and `< -P - 4` for `cos` and `tan`. At 128 bits that takes `sin(1e-20)`
  from 0.51 to 0.125 us; MPFR takes 0.017. `mpfr_check` draws its trig special arguments on
  both sides of the cuts. A `sin` cut loosened 5 bits past the bound fails it.
- **Versine kernel** (#1760): `v = 1 - cos r`, then `cos r = 1 - v` and
  `|sin r| = sqrt(v (2 - v))`, neither of which cancels.
- **In fixed point** (#1790). `r` is halved `h` times, to `y = |r| / 2^h` below `2^-T`. With
  `z = y^2`, `v(y) = y^2 W(z) / 2`, where
  `W(z) = 2 sum_k (-1)^k z^k / (2k + 2)! = 1 - z/12 + z^2/360 - ...`
  lies in `(0.9, 1]` whatever the size of `y`.
  - **The series.** `W` is summed on exp's engine (`fixed_series`) with the divisors
    `d(t) = (2t + 1)(2t + 2)`, alternating and tapered. Fixed point loses nothing as `r -> 0`.
  - **Forming `v`.** `v = y^2 W / 2` comes from a `z` scaled to its own leading bit, as
    `V = v 2^(F + E)`.
  - **Doubling back.** `v(2y) = 4v - 2v^2` becomes `V' = V - V^2 / 2^(F + E + 1)` with `E`
    falling by 2: one square and a subtraction per doubling.
- **Error of the fixed-point versine.**
  - A doubling multiplies the relative error by `(1 - v) / (1 - v / 2) < 1` and adds one
    truncation, so the error does not grow with `h`.
  - With `F >= working + 24`, the kernel is within `2^-(working + 13)`. It returns `v` rounded
    to the working precision (`r`'s precision plus `h`), as the efloat kernel did.
  - Measured against MPFR from 24 to 8192 bits, `trig_working` lies 30.6-55 bits inside its
    declared bound for `sin`, `cos` and `tan`, and the versine within one ulp at `r`'s
    precision.
  - `elastic/efloat/math/trig_kernel.cpp` checks both bounds against plain efloat Taylor series.
    13 of 15 mutations of the versine and of the tapering fail it. Of the other two, turning
    tapering off changes only the speed, and dropping one limb too many in the taper is caught
    by `exp_kernel.cpp`.
- **The halving target.** `T = 0.22 sqrt(F)` was measured best, the optimum flat: 3 at 128 bits,
  10 at 2048, 20 at 8192. Each halving gains the series in `z` two bits a term, so the
  optimum lies below exp's.
- **Work per call:** at 128 bits, 19 terms in blocks of 5, 8 products and 2 doublings on 4
  limbs. At 8192 bits, 155 terms in blocks of only 3, because the divisors are about `4 t^2`,
  54 products and 19 doublings.
- **Measured speed:** `sin`, `cos` and `tan` run 0.9-1.1x MPFR up to 2048 bits and 1.1-1.2x at
  8192 on the benchmark argument. Over arguments from `1e-20` to 100, inside and outside
  `pi/4` and near `pi/2`, they run 0.3-1.4x at 512 bits and up; the worst is `cos(1.2)`, at
  1.4x at 512 bits. At 128 bits they run 0.4-1.4x, with three exceptions:
  - `cos(1.2)` at 2.1x;
  - `cos(-10.3)` at 1.6x;
  - tiny `x`, at 3.6-4.3x against MPFR's 0.017 us fast path.
- **History.** The efloat kernel before #1790 (`h ~ 0.25 sqrt(P) + 6` halvings, `u ~ 0.21
  P^0.35` partial sums, `(h, u) = (11, 2)` at 512 bits, `(17, 3)` at 2048, `(28, 5)` at 8192;
  #1766) ran every term and doubling as a rounded efloat operation: `sin` at 2.7x / 2.2x / 1.9x
  / 1.5x MPFR at 128 / 512 / 2048 / 8192 bits.
- **Rejected** (#1760): tapering the plain sin/cos series alone reached only 2.2x mpmath;
  halving with sin/cos double-angle formulas costs two multiplies a step and did not pay.
- **atan** (#1774): one kernel for `atan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan2`: reflect `|x| > 1`, halve by
  `a / (sqrt(a^2 + 1) + 1)` about `sqrt(W/10)` times, then the series. It replaced a series
  that gained 0.6 bits a term near `|x| = 0.8` (asin at 8192 bits: 13.8 ms to 0.5 ms).
- **Open.**
  - Payne-Hanek for huge arguments.
  - Binary splitting at high precision (MPFR's `sin_cos`).
  - Past `2^40` the reduction still divides.
  - Odd quadrants form `sin r` as `sqrt(v (2 - v))`: `cos(1.2)` at 128 bits is 2.1x MPFR, the worst
    measured case. A sine series of its own in fixed point would remove the root.
  - A two-limb block divisor. The versine's divisors are about `4 t^2`, which caps its blocks at
    3-5 terms.
  - mpmath caches a sin/cos table below 400 bits.

### 4.4 Hyperbolic

`sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh` from `expm1`, as `u(u+2)/(2(u+1))` and `w/(w+2)`, so nothing cancels as
`x -> 0`; `asinh`, `acosh`, `atanh` as `log1p` of an argument that does not cancel
(`atanh` works on `|x|`; before #1774 `atanh` near -1 was off by up to `2^900` ulps).

### 4.5 pow

`pow(x, y) = exp(y log x)` with `log x` carried at the target plus the magnitude of `y log x`,
so its error is not multiplied by `y` (#1739). Exact powers are found first and rounded once:
`x = 2^e` with `e y` an integer; `x^n` whose `n (bits(x) - 1)` fits the precision; `y = m/2^k`
with `|x|` a perfect `2^k`-th power (a mod-8 filter rejects most non-squares). `pow(x, int)`
uses binary powering with guard bits; before #1774 it was off by up to 32 ulps from repeated
rounded products.

### 4.6 tgamma, lgamma (#1779)

- Stirling's series (DLMF 5.11.1) after shifting `x` up to `z >= 0.3 W`
  (`gamma_shift_per_bit`): `lgamma x = lgamma(x + N) - log(x (x+1) ... (x+N-1))`. The remainder
  is bounded by the first omitted term (DLMF 5.11(ii)).
- The coefficients `B_2k / (2k(2k-1))` come from the Brent-Harvey tangent-number recurrence
  (*Modern Computer Arithmetic* 4.7.2): positive additions and small-integer products, cached
  per thread.
- Below 0, reflection with `n = round(x)` and `f = x - n`, which is exact. Near the zeros of
  lgamma at 1 and 2, and near the poles, the working precision is raised by the cancellation.
- `tgamma = sign * exp(lgamma)`, with lgamma to absolute accuracy; `(n-1)!` is exact while it
  fits twice the result's width.
- Before: `std::tgamma(double(x))`, 53 bits at most, inf past 171.6.
- **Open.** `lgamma` near 1 at 8192 bits is 7.5x slower than MPFR, because the cancellation is
  only discovered by a first pass. Estimating it up front from `|x - 1|` and `|x - 2|` is the
  fix.

### 4.7 erf, erfc (#1781)

- `erf x = 2/sqrt(pi) e^{-x^2} sum t_n`, `t_n = t_{n-1} 2x^2/(2n+1)` (A&S 7.1.6, MPFR's
  `mpfr_erf_0`): all terms positive, so nothing cancels; `x^2` exact; tapered precision.
- `erfc` for large `x`: the asymptotic series (DLMF 7.12.1), used when its smallest term lies
  below the working precision (`x^2 log2 e >= W + 8`); otherwise `1 - erf x` with the cancelled
  bits added (bounded by A&S 7.1.13); for `x < 0`, `1 + erf |x|`.
- Results within `2^-(P+5)` of +-1 (or of 2, for `erfc` of a negative x) round through
  `round_near`. `erfc` returns +0 with Underflow only past efloat's exponent range.
- Before: `std::erf(double(x))`; `erfc` was 0 from `x = 27.2` on, and all four modes returned
  the same value.

### 4.8 cbrt, hypot, fma, fmod, remainder (#1783)

Until #1783 these five were computed at the result's precision but rounded more than once, and
`mpfr_check` found 889 to 2,063 wrong results each in 3,234 cases.

- **Exact sums.** `hypot` and `fma` add two exact values: `x^2 + y^2`, or the exact product
  `x y` (`exact_product`: `a + b` bits for operands of `a` and `b`) plus `z`. `exact_sum` in
  `exponent.hpp` adds them at the width that holds the sum exactly, except when the smaller
  lies wholly below the last bit `2^L` of the larger carried at `pad` bits. Then it adds a
  proxy of the same sign, `2^(L-2)`, instead. The true and the proxied sums lie strictly
  between the larger and its neighbour `2^(L-1)` away, so they round alike to any precision up
  to `pad - 2` bits, and their square roots alike up to `(pad - 4) / 2`. That keeps the width
  bounded whatever the exponent gap. `fma` passes `pad = P + 2` and rounds the sum once;
  `hypot` passes `2P + 4` and takes the exact root (`sqrt_to`, which rounds once).
- **fma at the range's ends** (#1786). When `scale(x) + scale(y)` leaves `[min_scale,
  max_scale)`, the exact product would overflow or underflow, though `x y + z` may not. Both
  terms are then scaled by `2^-t`, where `t` is the larger term's scale. A term more than
  `2^62` binades below the larger one is raised to `2^(min_scale + 2)`. It still lies far below
  the larger term's last bit, so `exact_sum` proxies it and the rounding is unchanged. The sum
  rounds at `P`, and multiplying by `2^t` brings it back, overflowing or underflowing as a product
  would. For a finite `x y` and an infinite `z`, `fma` returns `z`; computing `x * y` first could
  overflow and give `inf - inf`.
- **hypot** scales both arguments by `2^-k`, `k = scale(max)`, so the squares stay inside the
  exponent range, and multiplies the root back. When the arguments are more than
  `max(bits(max), P + 2) + 8` binades apart, the result is `max` plus a positive amount below
  its last bit, and a proxy sum gives it directly.
- **cbrt.** `a = m 8^k`, `m` in `[1, 8)`; Newton's iteration `y <- y + (m / y^2 - y) / 3` from
  `std::cbrt` of `double(m)`, at a precision that doubles with each step to 16 bits past the
  working precision, then once more there. Measured within `2^-(target + 64 + 12)`, declared
  `cbrt_error_bits = 8`; the regression test checks that bound directly. Ziv's strategy rounds
  it. A boundary is a binary fraction, so only an exact root can be one. Before Ziv, the first
  evaluation is rounded to nearest at `P + 32` bits and cubed: if that gives `a` exactly, the
  root is exact and rounds once. Before #1783, Newton ran at full precision from a one-bit
  seed and rounded unchecked: 6-33x MPFR's time and wrong in a quarter of the cases.
- **fmod** is exact: its result always fits the wider operand precision. With `2^lo` the
  smaller of the operands' last bits, `X = |x| 2^-lo = mx 2^d` and `Y = |y| 2^-lo` are
  integers, and `X mod Y = (mx mod Y)(2^d mod Y) mod Y`. `2^d mod Y` takes `log2 d` squarings
  modulo `Y`, so a quotient of `2^(2^40)` costs about 40 modular squarings, not `2^40`
  subtraction steps. Each `mod` is an exact division, truncated and corrected by one `Y`.
- **remainder** takes `|x| mod 2|y|`: whether that is at least `|y|` is the quotient's parity,
  which breaks the tie when the remainder is exactly `|y| / 2`.
- Special values as IEEE 754: `fmod(x, inf) = x` (before, NaN), `fma(inf, 0, z)` NaN, zero
  results signed as `x` for `fmod` and `remainder` and by the rounding mode for `fma`'s exact
  cancellation.

### 4.9 Constants

The library computes its own constants at the working precision and caches the widest value
per thread: `ln2 = 2 atanh(1/3)`, `ln10 = 3 ln2 + 2 atanh(1/9)`, `pi` by Machin's formula,
`atan(1/2) = atan(1/3) + atan(1/7)`. The public `efloat_pi/e/phi<nlimbs>()` are 1000-digit
literals that carry the type's width; #1739 stopped using them inside functions, because a
value widened past the type's width was reduced with a narrower `pi`. The first call at a new
precision pays to fill the caches, which matters for benchmarks.

## 5. Verification

Four kinds of check, each catching what the others miss.

1. **Regression tests** (`elastic/efloat/`, run in CI): exact oracles where one exists
   (`arithmetic/correct_rounding.cpp`, `conversion/subnormal_rounding.cpp`,
   `math/sqrt_precision.cpp` with Hensel-lifted radicands that reach the sticky-decisive case),
   independent second methods (`math/error_and_gamma.cpp` checks erf against the alternating
   Maclaurin series carried with the cancelled bits), mpmath-generated vectors
   (`tools/generators/efloat_exp_log_gen.py` -> `verification/efloat_exp_log_vectors.hpp`,
   `efloat_parse_gen.py` -> `efloat_parse_vectors.hpp`), and the `*_working` error contracts.
   Each test added with a fix fails on the code before it (the PR states how many cases).
2. **MPFR, bit for bit** (`benchmark/accuracy/efloat/mpfr_check.cpp`, built when MPFR is
   found): every function in all four modes at 32-8192 bits, five argument styles including
   each function's special arguments. The ctest runs a quick sweep up to 512 bits; with no
   arguments it runs the full one in about 25 s.
3. **Bit identity** for speed work: a change that should not alter results is run over a
   sweep of several hundred thousand results against the previous headers (`git show main:` or
   `git archive` of every changed header into a scratch include tree) and must differ nowhere.
4. **Mutation testing**: each PR since #1767 broke its own fix in named ways (a guard set to
   0, a sign flipped, a branch removed) and recorded which mutants the tests catch. Survivors
   are listed in the PRs; most are slack absorbed by another guard.

## 6. Measured accuracy

`mpfr_check`, full run (scale 1, up to 8192 bits), MPFR 4.2.2, after #1783. On main at 2076edb7,
before it, the same run found `cbrt` 889 wrong, `hypot` 1656, `fma` 926, `fmod` 1546 and
`remainder` 2063, and 0 everywhere else.

Per function: 1000 cases at each of 32, 64 and 128 bits, 200 at 512, 30 at 2048 and 4 at
8192, a quarter in each rounding mode. A case is wrong unless value, sign and precision all
match MPFR. `double` and `float` are the conversions, half of them in or below the subnormal
range.

| function | cases | wrong | |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `add` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `sub` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `mul` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `div` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `sqrt` | 3234 | 0 | |

| `remainder` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `exp` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `exp2` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `exp10` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `expm1` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `log` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `log2` | 3234 | 0 | |

| `atan` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `atan2` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `sinh` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `cosh` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `tanh` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `asinh` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `acosh` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `atanh` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `pow` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `powi` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `tgamma` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `lgamma` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `erf` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `erfc` | 3183 | 0 | |
| `double` | 3234 | 0 | |
| `float` | 3234 | 0 | |

The sweep takes about 25 s; `mpfr_check 10` takes ten times the cases. The checks run for each
PR were larger and are recorded there: 42,520 cases for log (#1771), 53,728 for exp, sin, cos
and tan (#1772), 228,000 for the functions of #1774, 73,500 for sqrt (#1770), 321,600
conversions (#1778) and 19,338 each for gamma (#1779) and erf (#1781), all with 0 wrong after
the fix. 51 `erfc` cases are not compared: their results lie below MPFR's smallest exponent, where
efloat returns +0 with Underflow.

## 7. Measured speed

`mpfr_gap`, best of three, warm caches, microseconds per call, round to nearest.
Measured 2026-10-22 with #1790 (the versine kernel, tapering) on top of main at 99e5f5c5, Intel Core i7-12700K, g++ 15.2 `-O3 -march=native`,
MPFR 4.2.2, GMP 6.3.0; `a = 0.718...`, `b = 1.414...`, `x = 1 + a`. Each cell is
efloat / MPFR in microseconds, then the ratio.

  mostly `lgamma`'s series, so it stays at 3-6x.
- **sin, cos, tan** (#1790): 1.1-1.2x at 8192 bits, against 2.1-3.3x at 128 bits and 1.5x at
  8192 before.
- **cbrt, hypot, fma** (remeasured after #1783): `cbrt` 2.5-3.3x (was 6-33x), `hypot`
  2.1-2.5x, `fma` 1.7-4.1x. `fma` is slower than before at small precisions (0.12 us at 128 bits
  against 0.045): it now forms the exact product and sum, where it used to round twice and was
  wrong in 29% of the cases.
- **The primitives set the floor:** `a*b`, `b/a` and `sqrt` run 1.5-2.3x MPFR, and every
  function built on them inherits that. The inverse trig functions run 0.9-3.1x and the
  log-based ones 1.1-2.4x.
- **Largest gaps:** `lgamma(1.414...)` at
  8192 bits (18x; on #1779's random arguments it was 2.1-7.5x, and the cost #1779 identified
  is the second, wider pass that cancellation near the zeros at 1 and 2 forces; this argument
  has not been profiled), `tgamma` (4-6x), and the inverse trig family at 8192 bits (3x).

**Benchmark hygiene.** Single runs of the mpmath comparison vary by 15-50%; compare branches
with best-of-5 runs on an idle machine. Warm the caches first. The first-call cost of a new
precision (filling `ln2`, `pi`, the log table, the Bernoulli numbers) is real but separate.
A change to one function can move unrelated rows by a few percent through code layout, since
`mpfr_gap` is one translation unit: #1790 moved untouched rows by up to 4% at 128 bits under
g++, and neither an isolated translation unit nor clang showed the move. Check a surprising
row both ways before reading it as a cost.

## 9. Open work

**Library gaps.** An exact integer cube root with remainder, like `sqrtrem`, would make `cbrt`
cheaper than Newton under Ziv.

**Speed** (Epic #1763): short (high-half) products and MPFR's can-round on them; Toom-3; short
division (`divhigh`); the fixed-point series engine of exp and the versine (#1788, #1790)
carried over to atanh, atan and expm1; a cheap first Ziv try at `p + log2(p)` guard bits instead of 64; binary
splitting for exp and sin/cos;
binary-splitting constants; Sasaki-Kanada AGM start; up-front cancellation estimate for lgamma;
heap-free, least-significant-first storage; Payne-Hanek reduction for huge trig arguments;
ratio guards in CI beyond the existing division-to-multiply one.

## 10. Working on it

For a speed change:

1. Measure first: `mpfr_gap name1,name2` before and after, best of several runs.
2. Prove the results did not move: a bit-identity sweep against the old headers.
3. Run `mpfr_check` in full.
4. If the change touches a guard or an error bound, re-measure the `*_working` contract at
   32-8192 bits in all four modes, and keep the declared bound at least 16 bits clear.

For an accuracy change:

1. Reproduce against MPFR (`mpfr_check 4 fname`), or against an exact oracle.
2. Add a regression test that fails on the old code, including the `*_working` contract if
   there is one, and check that each part of the fix, reverted alone, fails it.
3. Mark the commit `BEHAVIOUR-CHANGE:` (see CLAUDE.md), since results move.

Wilkinson's polynomial
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson's_polynomial

In numerical analysis, Wilkinson's polynomial is a specific polynomial 
which was used by James H. Wilkinson in 1963 to illustrate a difficulty 
when finding the root of a polynomial: the location of the roots can be 
very sensitive to perturbations in the coefficients of the polynomial.

# Float Cascade to model multi-component floats

Let's walk through how this `FloatCascade<N>` building block architecture naturally extends to support adaptive precision `priest`. The key insight is that `priest` uses a **variable-length** cascade that can grow and shrink as needed.

Here's how the `FloatCascade<N>` building block architecture supports adaptive precision `priest`:

## Key Architectural Elements:

### 1. **VariableCascade - Dynamic Version of FloatCascade<N>**

  - Uses `std::vector<double>` instead of `std::array<double, N>`

  - Can grow/shrink during computation

  - Same component ordering principles as fixed-size cascades

  - Provides seamless conversion to/from `FloatCascade<N>`


### 2. **Bidirectional Conversion Between Fixed and Adaptive**

```cpp

// Fixed → Adaptive (promotion)
dd d1(1.0);
priest p1(d1);  // Seamless conversion

// Adaptive → Fixed (truncation/extraction)
priest result = some.complex_calculation();
dd final.dd = result.to_dd();  // Extract to double-double
td final.td = result.to_td();  // Extract to triple-double

```

### 3. **Adaptive Precision Control**

The `priest` class uses `AdaptivePrecision` config to control:

  - **Termination criteria**: When to stop iterating (1/3 problem solved!)

  - **Component limits**: Max/min cascade length

  - **Tolerance**: Absolute vs relative error bounds

  - **Performance**: Early termination, auto-compression



### 4. **The 1/3 Solution in Action**

```cpp

struct AdaptivePrecision {
    double relative_tolerance;
    unsigned max_components;
    unsigned max_iterations;
};
AdaptivePrecision high_precision{
    .relative_tolerance = 1e-25,  // Very tight tolerance
    .max_components = 20,         // Allow up to 20 components
    .max_iterations = 50          // Limit iterations
};

priest one(1.0, high.precision);
priest three(3.0, high.precision);
priest one.third = one / three;  // Adapts precision automatically!

```

The division algorithm:

1. **Starts** with hardware precision estimate

2. **Iterates** using Newton-Raphson refinement

3. **Terminates** when error tolerance is met OR max iterations reached

4. **Controls** component growth to prevent explosion

5. **Compresses** result to remove unnecessary precision

### 5. **Seamless Workflow**

```cpp

// Start with fixed precision (fast)
dd quick.calc = dd(1.0) / dd(3.0);  // Limited precision

// Need more precision? Promote seamlessly
priest precise.calc = priest(quick_calc);
precise.calc = priest(1.0) / priest(3.0);  // Now adaptive!

// Back to fixed for performance-critical code
td final.result = precise_calc.to_td();

```



### 6. **Shared ExpansionOps Engine**

All types (`dd`, `td`, `qd`, `priest`) use the same core algorithms:

  - `two_sum`, `fast_two_sum` for basic operations

  - Expansion addition/multiplication algorithms

  - Same mathematical foundations, different precision strategies



## Benefits of This Architecture:



1. **No Precision Walls**: Smooth upgrade path from `dd` → `td` → `qd` → `priest`

2. **Performance Flexibility**: Use fixed precision when speed matters, adaptive when accuracy matters

3. **Building Block Reuse**: Same `FloatCascade` principles throughout

4. **Controlled Iteration**: Solves the "infinite 1/3" problem with configurable termination

5. **Universal Compatibility**: All types can interchange via `FloatCascade` extraction



This design gives us what Priest intended: **adaptive precision that does only as much work as necessary to guarantee a correct result**, while maintaining Universal's principle of independent, interoperable number systems!

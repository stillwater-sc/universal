# Development Sessions

This directory contains detailed records of development sessions for the Universal Numbers Library.

## Purpose

Session documents provide:
- **Historical context** for design decisions
- **Implementation details** beyond git commit messages
- **Lessons learned** during development
- **Testing insights** and validation approaches
- **Roadmap tracking** for multi-milestone features

## Format

Each session document follows a standard structure:

### Header
```markdown
# Development Session: [Feature Name] - [Milestone]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Branch:** branch-name
**Focus:** Brief description
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete | üîÑ In Progress | ‚è≥ Planned
```

### Sections
1. **Session Overview** - Goals and high-level summary
2. **Key Decisions** - Design choices and rationale
3. **Implementation Details** - What was built and how
4. **Technical Insights** - Deep dives into algorithms/approaches
5. **Testing & Validation** - Test coverage and results
6. **Challenges & Solutions** - Problems encountered and fixes
7. **Performance Characteristics** - Complexity analysis, benchmarks
8. **Next Steps** - Roadmap for follow-on work
9. **References** - Papers, related code, external resources
10. **Appendix** - Commands, file locations, tips

## Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-milestone.md
```

Examples:
- `2025-01-26-expansion-operations-milestone-1.md`
- `2025-02-01-ereal-arithmetic-integration.md`
- `2025-02-15-geometric-predicates-implementation.md`

## For Contributors

When documenting a development session:

1. **Create file early** - Start documenting as you work, not after
2. **Include rationale** - Explain *why* decisions were made, not just *what*
3. **Record failures** - Document what didn't work and why
4. **Link to code** - Reference file paths, line numbers, functions
5. **Update CHANGELOG** - Keep `../../CHANGELOG.md` in sync
6. **Link references** - Cite papers, prior art, related work

## Relationship to Other Documentation

**When to use each:**
- **Session docs**: Deep technical narrative of development work
- **CHANGELOG**: Concise list of changes for users
- **Design docs**: Architectural decisions and patterns
- **API docs**: Reference for using the library

## Search Tips

To find sessions by topic:

```bash
# Search for a feature
grep -r "expansion" docs/sessions/

# Find all complete milestones
grep -r "Status: ‚úÖ" docs/sessions/

# List all sessions chronologically
ls -1 docs/sessions/*.md | sort
```

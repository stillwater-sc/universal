## Quick Summary

### Four Approaches

1. **Priest (1991)**: Theoretical foundation
   - Defined error-free transformations (two_sum, two_prod)
   - Proved error bounds and stability properties
   - Established multi-component representation theory

2. **Bailey/Hida (2000-2008)**: Fixed precision implementation
   - Created dd (double-double): 2 components, ~31 decimal digits
   - Created qd (quad-double): 4 components, ~62 decimal digits
   - Production C++/Fortran library for scientific computing
   - **Universal's dd and qd implementations are based on this work**

3. **Shewchuk (1996-1997)**: Adaptive precision (eager evaluation)
   - Dynamic precision growth based on computational need
   - Optimized for computational geometry predicates
   - Fast for typical cases, correct for pathological cases
   - **Universal's planned priest implementation follows this approach**

4. **McCleeary (2019)**: Exact lazy real arithmetic (lazy evaluation)
   - Stream-based representation with on-demand precision
   - Deferred computation until results actually needed
   - Infinite precision capability with finite resources
   - **Universal's planned elrealo (Exact Lazy Real Oracle) implementation extends Priest/Bailey/Shewchuk**

### Universal Library Implementation Status

- ‚úÖ **dd (double-double)**: Complete, production-ready (Bailey/Hida approach)
- ‚úÖ **qd (quad-double)**: Complete, production-ready (Bailey/Hida approach)
- üü° **td (triple-double)**: Header structure exists, arithmetic incomplete (Bailey/Hida approach)
- ‚ùå **priest (adaptive eager)**: Design complete, implementation not started (Shewchuk approach)
- ‚ùå **elrealo (Exact Lazy Real Oracle)**: Design complete, implementation not started (McCleeary approach)
  - Oracle type for mixed-precision SDK numerical assessments
  - Provides exact real evaluations on-demand

data preprocessing of images vs language


mixed-precision
layer to layer what do our activations look like?

what are the trouble cases?
- the layer transformation expands the dynamic range of the input activations


log-normal distributions  (the gradients are log-normal)  normal distributed in log space

what does a log-normal distribution look like in linear space?

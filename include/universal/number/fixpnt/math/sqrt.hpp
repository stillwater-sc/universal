	/*
	- Consider the function argument, x, in floating-point form, with a base
	(or radix) B, exponent e, and a fraction, f , such that 1/B <= f < 1.
	Then we have x = f Be. The number of bits in the exponent and
	fraction, and the value of the base, depends on the particular floating
	point arithmetic system chosen.

	- Use properties of the elementary function to range reduce the argument
	x to a small fixed interval.

	- Use a small polynomial approximation to produce an initial estimate,
	y0, of the function on the small interval. Such an estimate may
	be good to perhaps 5 to 10 bits.

	- Apply Newton iteration to refine the result. This takes the form yk =
	yk_1/2 + (f /2)/yk_1. In base 2, the divisions by two can be done by
	exponent adjustments in floating-point computation, or by bit shifting
	in fixed-point computation.

	Convergence of the Newton method is quadratic, so the number of
	correct bits doubles with each iteration. Thus, a starting point correct
	to 7 bits will produce iterates accurate to 14, 28, 56, ... bits. Since the
	number of iterations is very small, and known in advance, the loop is
	written as straight-line code.

	- Having computed the function value for the range-reduced argument,
	make whatever adjustments are necessary to produce the function value
	for the original argument; this step may involve a sign adjustment,
	and possibly a single multiplication and/or addition.

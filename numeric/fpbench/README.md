This directory contains benchmark tests curated in the community resource: FPBENCH [FPbench](https://fpbench.org).

## Numerical Performance Metrics

FPBench proposed five axes of measurement:

1.   Scaling versus non-scaling
    -   Absolute error, relative error, ULPs, bits, ...
2.   Forward versus backward
    -   Fixed input error versus fixed output error
3.   Maximum versus average
    -   L1-norm, mean-square error, etc.
4.   Sound versus statistical
    -   Formal guarantees versus mathematical accuracy
5.   Improvement
    -   Individual inputs versus aggregate/average accuracy

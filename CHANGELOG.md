## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### 2025-01-26 - Expansion Operations: Scalar Operations & Compression (Milestone 2)
- Extended `expansion_ops.hpp` with scalar multiplication and compression:
  - `scale_expansion()` - Scalar multiplication with error-free transformations
  - `compress_expansion()` - Remove insignificant components based on threshold
  - `compress_to_n()` - Compress to at most N components
  - `sign_adaptive()` - O(1) to O(k) sign determination
  - `compare_adaptive()` - Component-wise adaptive comparison
- Created comprehensive test suites:
  - `internal/expansion/api/compression.cpp` - Compression and adaptive operations tests
  - `internal/expansion/arithmetic/addition.cpp` - Addition property tests (identity, commutivity, associativity)
  - `internal/expansion/arithmetic/multiplication.cpp` - Scalar multiplication tests
  - `internal/expansion/performance/benchmark.cpp` - Performance benchmarking
- All tests passing: compression (5/5), addition (5/5), multiplication (6/6)
- Performance benchmarks show expected algorithmic complexity

#### 2025-01-26 - Expansion Operations Infrastructure (Milestone 1)
- Added Shewchuk's adaptive precision floating-point expansion algorithms
- Created `include/sw/universal/internal/expansion/expansion_ops.hpp` with core algorithms:
  - `two_sum()` - Error-free transformation for addition (Knuth/Dekker)
  - `fast_two_sum()` - Optimized EFT when |a| >= |b| (Dekker)
  - `two_prod()` - Error-free multiplication using FMA
  - `grow_expansion()` - Add single component to expansion (Shewchuk Figure 6)
  - `fast_expansion_sum()` - Merge two nonoverlapping expansions (Shewchuk Figure 8)
  - `linear_expansion_sum()` - Robust expansion merging (Shewchuk Figure 7)
  - Utility functions: `estimate()`, `is_decreasing_magnitude()`, `is_nonoverlapping()`, `is_strongly_nonoverlapping()`
- Created test infrastructure for expansion operations:
  - `internal/expansion/api/api.cpp` - API usage examples
  - `internal/expansion/api/expansion_ops.cpp` - Comprehensive unit tests
  - `internal/expansion/CMakeLists.txt` - Build configuration
- Integrated expansion tests into main build system
- All tests passing (7/7 test suites)

#### Documentation
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` to track repository changes
- Created `docs/sessions/` directory for development session records
- Added session documentation for expansion operations implementation

### Fixed

#### 2025-01-26 - Critical Bug in fast_expansion_sum (Milestone 2)
- **Bug**: `fast_expansion_sum()` was calling `fast_two_sum(next_component, q, ...)` with arguments in wrong order
  - FAST-TWO-SUM requires |a| >= |b| as precondition
  - Algorithm was passing smaller component first, violating the invariant
  - Result: Loss of precision, inexact results despite "error-free" transformations
- **Fix**: Changed to use `two_sum(q, next_component, ...)` which works for any argument order
  - TWO-SUM: 6 ops, always correct
  - FAST-TWO-SUM: 3 ops, requires magnitude ordering
  - Trade-off: Correctness over speed (can optimize later with magnitude checks)
- **Key Learning**: Manually constructed arrays like `{10.0, 1.0e-15}` are NOT valid expansions
  - Valid expansions must be created using EFT operations (two_sum, grow_expansion, etc.)
  - Manual arrays lack the exact representation properties required by expansion algorithms
  - Test cases updated to use proper expansion construction
- **Impact**: All addition arithmetic tests now pass with exact identity property: (a+b)-a = b

### Technical Details

**Expansion Operations (Shewchuk 1997)**

The expansion operations implement adaptive precision floating-point arithmetic based on
Jonathan Richard Shewchuk's seminal paper "Adaptive Precision Floating-Point Arithmetic
and Fast Robust Geometric Predicates" (Discrete & Computational Geometry 18:305-363, 1997).

Key differences from Priest's fixed-precision algorithms (used in `floatcascade`):
- **Variable component count**: Expansions can grow/shrink dynamically
- **Adaptive algorithms**: Only examine as many components as needed
- **Strongly nonoverlapping**: Stricter invariant than Priest's nonoverlapping
- **Geometric predicates**: Optimized for orientation tests, incircle tests, etc.

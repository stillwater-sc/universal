James: I modified your chebfun function as it needed a matrix constructor. 
However, you are looping from 0 to n, which is n+1 rows and columns,
       which surprised me, so I need you to take a look at this and see if I did the right thing.

Theo: In chebfun.hpp, lines 39 and 40 is how we step it up 10/16/2021.  Just wondering about the reversion
    back to Func instead of *f().  Also, n+1 because a polynomial of degree n has n+1 terms, i.e., 
    a_0 + a_1*T_1 + a_2*T_2 + ... + a_n*T_n.
    However, after sleeping on it, I may want to change to n x n, and just keep in mind, that would
    coorespond to a n-1 degree polynomial.  

    chebmat is the change of basis matrix.

Abstract
 The relation among reliable computation time, Tc, float-point precision, K, and the
Lyapunov exponent, λ, is obtained as Tc= (lnB/λ)K+C, where B is the base of the float-point
system and C is a constant dependent only on the chaotic equation. The equation shows good
agreement with numerical experimental results, especially the scale factors.

Keywords: reliable computation time, Lyapunov exponent, float precision

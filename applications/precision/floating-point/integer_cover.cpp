When interacting with integer algebras, for example, prime factorization
algorithms, factorials, binomials, and discretization schemes, a posit
would need to be able to represent the integers to be error-free.

We are interested to see how well a posit configuration can capture integer values.

A sample output of this program to provide insight in the sampling behavior of 
linear and tapered floating point:

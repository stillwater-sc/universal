Basic Linear Algebra subroutine examples

## How to build

The examples are automatically build by cmake when using BUILD_APPLICATIONS=ON or building the full CI suite with BUILD_CI_CHECK=ON.

## Fused-dot product

The key differentiator of posits to deliver error-free linear algebra is the Fused DOT product (FDP) operation.
